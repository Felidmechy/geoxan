# raudio
A simple and easy-to-use audio library based on miniaudio

`raudio` forks from raylib.audio module to become an standalone library. Actually, it was already possible to use this module as standalone for audio device management and sounds/music playing, it has just been moved to its own repo.

`raudio` API tries to be very simple and intuitive and it represents a thin layer over the powerful [miniaudio library](https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio), including support for multiple audio formats: WAV, OGG, MP3, FLAC, MOD, XM.

**This project is a WORK IN PROGRESS**
